        <li>Include at least 2-3 images for the content.</li>
        <li>Include title, headings, and subheadings in the content.</li>
        <li>
          Divide the content into small paragraphs for ease of readability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the sentences short with a maximum of 15 words per sentence.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are including facts and numbers in the article, research it
          thoroughly. Include the source along with the facts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to write the articles in an active voice. Passive voice sentences

        </li>
        <li>
          Write with a keyword in mind. Include the keyword in the title and

          Add at least 2 links within the post. The links should be related to
          the topic you're writing on. You can link to our previous blog posts
          too. We will love that!

      <h3>Some Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

      <h4>Why should I submit through Google Docs?</h4>

        document together as a team.
      </p>

      <h4>Should I pitch my topic before writing the post?</h4>
      <p>Yes, you can definitely do that, but it's not a necessity.</p>

      <h4>Can I include links to my posts?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, if the links are relevant, then you can do so. Include at least 2
        related links in your content. They could be links to your posts, other
        blogs, or our previous posts.

        content readable and engaging. While we may edit some areas of your
